Hnefatafl is an old viking board game that has many rule variations. What
follows are the rules used in this implementation. In short this is Fetlar
Hnefatafl.

Pieces:
There are two teams, red and green. Red are the attackers (r) with their pieces
initially at the edges of the board. Green are the defenders and are comprised
of 12 green pieces (g) and a king (G). Red moves first.

Board:
11x11 board with 5 special tiles: each of the 4 corners (x) (escapes) and the
center tile (y) (throne) where the king starts the game.

Movement:
All pieces, including the king, move as rooks do in Chess. No piece except the
king can occupy the special tiles. However pieces can move through the throne
tile.

Capture:
A normal piece is captured if, by an aggressor, a piece is sandwiched between
two pieces of the opposing side e.g.

--before
r,g, , ,r,

--after movement
r,g,r, , ,

--capture
r, ,r, , ,

However, if a piece moves between two members of the opposing side it is not
captured.

--before
r, ,r, ,
 , , , ,
 ,g, , ,

--after movement, no capture
r,g,r, ,
 , , , ,
 , , , ,

 For the king to be captured he must be surrounded on all 4 sides by the enemy
 (enclosure) e.g.

--before
  ,r, , ,
 r,G,r, ,
  , , , ,
  ,r, , ,

 --after movement
  ,r, , ,
 r,G,r, ,
  ,r, , ,
  , , , ,

 --capture
  ,r, , ,
 r, ,r, ,
  ,r, , ,
  , , , ,

The king is also captured if he is one space from his throne and surrounded on
all 3 other sides by the enemy. The king is not captured if he is against a
wall surrounded on three sides by the enemy (though he is unable to move).


For the purpose of capturing, the escapes act as a hostile piece to either
team. The throne, when unoccupied by the king, acts as a hostile piece as well.

--before
 x,g, , ,
  , , , ,
  , , , ,
  , ,r, ,

 --after movement
 x,g,r, ,
  , , , ,
  , , , ,
  , , , ,

 --capture
 x, ,r, ,
  , , , ,

When a piece is captured it is removed from the board like standard piece
capture board games.

Victory:
For the defenders to win, they must get the king to one of the 4 escapes. For
the attackers, they must capture the king. Either team loses if they are unable
to move a piece.
